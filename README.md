# Webshop

A fullstack Webshop built entirely in Swift.

Backend is setup with PostgreSQL locally as the database. The backend-application is created using Swift with Vapor.
Each table in the database has it's own service in the backend application.

The iOS-application is done entirely in Swift with SwiftUI using TCA as the architecture.
